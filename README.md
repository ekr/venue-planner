venue-planner
=============

Tools for planning meeting venues. There are two tools here:

* `compute-cost.py` -- computes the travel time cost 
  to attend venue(s) for a given mix of attendees 
* `plan-rotation.py` -- plans the rotation for a set of
  future meetings given the constraints of other planned
  meetings
